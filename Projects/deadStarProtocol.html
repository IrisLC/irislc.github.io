        <p>A third person escape room-esque game made in 1 week for the Universal University 2025 Game Jam.
          <br>
          Worked in a group of 6, as one of two programmers (focusing on the level functions), as well as aiding in team
          management.
        </p>

        <p>This project was my first foray into participating in game jams, as well as working in a group with such
          tight timing</p>

        <p>Itch.io page for the game can be found <a href="https://adwai.itch.io/dead-star-protocol">here</a></p>
