        <p>Midterm assignment for an introductory 3D modeling class using Maya 2025. Tasked with choosing some structure
          around the college campus and building it in the engine, following reference images to make the proportions as
          true to life as possible. I chose Dorsey Hall, the dorm that I have lived in
          for the past 2 years.</p>
        <p>There are 3 images that were rendered for this assignment, the main one is the top image to the right, with
          the other two being made to better show off some of the detail work that was done. The main image is set in
          low light because I have many late classes and clubs, so I often see the dorm while the sun is setting, so I
          chose to capture that in the rendering. Additionally the one window with light shining through it is the room
          that I currently live in.</p>
        <p>No external tutorials were followed to create this, the only assistance I got from anywhere other than my
          professor were 3 bump maps that I downloaded online, everything else is fully my original creation.</p>
        <p>Estimated total time spent making this, not including errors: ~6 - 10 hours.</p>
